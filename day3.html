	<h2> The proper code writting in notepad must contain these:</h2>
	<p> <html> </html> </p>
	<p> <head> </head> </p>
	<p> <body> </body> </p>
	<p> The class was so good and easy to understand all thanks to Mr.Fredrick Achiever who make out time to carry everyone along.</p>
	<p> On reaching home to practice with joy,i tired on my own but was engulfed with scattered codes on my head...hahahahaha. </p>
	<p> Thank God for my notes and little videos i did at the end of the class,if not this assignment wouldn't have made it to reality and i would have let myself in my favourite course...smiles. </p>
